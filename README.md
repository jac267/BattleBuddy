What Are These Goddamn Buttons For?

Damage Input and Next Character:
BattleBuddy offers convenient shortcuts for managing damage and progressing through the initiative order.
Use the right arrow key to apply damage (or enter a negative value for healing) to the current character, 
and use the left arrow key to seamlessly move to the next character in the initiative order.

  -The Big Box (Battle Map):

  The big box, also known as the battle map, is your canvas for interacting with both enemies and players. 
  Here, you can effortlessly move them around, select them individually, or even select multiple entities at once using the "SHIFT" key.

  ******
  Personal Toolbar (Top Right):
  Starting from the top right corner, your personal toolbar houses a range of handy buttons. Let's explore them one by one:
  ******
  
  -Import Map Button:
  Use this button to import your own custom map. Click on it, and a prompt will guide you through the process of uploading your desired map image.

  -Add Character/Enemy Button:
  This magical button opens a menu that allows you to add characters or enemies to the battle map. 
  Simply select an image for their character icon, specify the number of enemies you want to add, and enter their hit points.
  You can also define attribute modifiers (such as +1 to +5) for each entity. 
  Moreover, if you wish to customize their initiative, you can either assign an initiative modifier or set a custom initiative value.

  -Token Size Adjustment:
  Adjacent to the character/enemy button, you'll find the token size adjustment feature. This comes in handy when you need to adjust the size of tokens on the battle map.
  It even works with multiple selections, allowing you to conveniently resize tokens to your liking.

  -Rolling Multiple Dice:
  In BattleBuddy, you can roll multiple dice simultaneously. To do this, locate the dice section, typically found on the side or bottom of the screen.
  Each type of dice, such as a d20 or d6, will have its own designated area.

  -Counter Reset (cc) Button:
  The "cc" button, short for "counter reset," is a useful tool within the dice section.
  It allows you to reset the dice counter, clearing any previous rolls or values that may have been accumulated during gameplay.

  -Saving throw:
  Saving Throw Tool:

  1.Select Foes: Choose the creatures needing a saving throw. (shift click on them)

  2.Choose Saving Throw Type: Use the drop-down list to select the appropriate saving throw type.

  3.Enter Damage Values: Specify the damage for failed and successful saves.

  4.Click "Go": BattleBuddy prompts for the difficulty level.

  5.Relax and Enjoy! BattleBuddy rolls the saves and applies damage automatically.

  -HP Display and Management:
  BattleBuddy simplifies HP tracking and management with an easy-to-use check box feature.

  Show/Hide Current HP: Toggle the check box to display or hide the current HP values.
  ***Automatic Removal: Foes with 0 HP are automatically deleted from the map.

  -Initiative Field: 
  BattleBuddy's Initiative Field displays the current initiative being played, with the "P" for pause when everyone has taken their turn.
